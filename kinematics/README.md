# Redundant Kinematics

A Python program with the basic kinematics equations with displacement, time, initial velocity, final velocity, and acceleration. I did forget that there's better kinematics equation solvers out there. I also forgot that I could've used an external algebra module (sympy?) and it wouldn't change accessibility, since I'd want to put it on a website anyway.
